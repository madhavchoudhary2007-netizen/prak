Would you like to know about specific plants with notable bioelectric properties?",
        "In the context of ethnobotany, bioelectric properties describe how plant-derived compounds interact with the body's electrical signaling systems. Plants like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Jatamansi, and Shankhpushpi have compounds that modulate neural bioelectric activity through ion channel regulation, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter modulation. This connects traditional descriptions like 'calming the nerves' to measurable bioelectric phenomena."
